# About me

I am a tenure-track assistant professor in <a href="https://cic.tju.edu.cn/english/home.htm">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm">Tianjin University</a> and a member of <a href="http://www.tjutanklab.com/">TANK Lab</a>, led by <a href="https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/likeqiu/index.html">Prof.Keqiu Li</a>. I received my Ph.D. degree from <a href="https://nsl.usc.edu/">Networked Systems Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>, advised by <a href="https://govindan.usc.edu/">Prof.Ramesh Govidan</a>. I obtained my B.S. degree at <a href="https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/">Prof. Xinbing Wang</a>.

My research interests include large language model (LLM) systems, deep neural network(DNN) systems, performance analysis and optimization, parallel and distributed computing. My recent work delves into developing inference systems capable of deploying LLM and DNN models in large-scale cloud clusters, aiming for peak performance, efficiency and scalability through innovative techniques such as computational acceleration, parallel optimization, and resource orchestration.

In collaboration with research institutions like IBM Watson, Samsung Research and Microsoft Research, I have published tens of papers at the leading conferences/journals, including SoCC, Ubicomp, INFOCOM, IWQoS, ASPLOS and TPDS. My research has been funed by NSFC, Huawei, etc. I have received honors such as Chun-Tsung Scholar from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Qiming Scholar from Tianjin University.

# Research 
My research is aiming to build inference systems capable of <i style="color: blue;font-style: normal;">deploying LLM and DNN models in large-scale cloud clusters </i>with peak performance, efficiency and scalability.

<h2>Large Language Model System</h2>

<div class='paper-box'><div class='paper-box-image'><div><img src='images/LLM_offline.png' alt="sym" width="100%"></div></div>
<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">
  <i style="white-space: nowrap !important;font-weight: bold;font-size: 1em;">Seving Classic LLM</i>: Serving LLM applications brings new challenges due to their huge memory consumption and unpredictable output length. We designed novel LLM inference systems (qLLM, tgLLM) to minimize job completion time across LLM requests and to maximize model throughput and resource utilization. We also built various inference systems (InferRAG, InferMM) to manage computation resources under scenarios such as RAG and multi-modal.

<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">
  <i style="white-space: nowrap !important;font-weight: bold;font-size: 1em;">Serving Specialized LLM</i>: Recent innovations in LLM architecture also bring new challenges. We designed specialized inference systems (SpecInfer, ParaMoE) to optimize the inference pipeline for speculative decoding and mixture of expert. Besides, we also investigated interesting topics such as lookahead decoding, LoRA serving, kv-cache optimization, etc.

<h2>Deep Neural Network System</h2>

<div class='paper-box'><div class='paper-box-image'><div><img src='images/DNN_SLOpt.png' alt="sym" width="100%"></div></div>
<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">
  <i style="white-space: nowrap !important;font-weight: bold;font-size: 1em;">Serving Specialized LLM</i>: To guarantee good user experiences, DNN-based applications are usually associated with a latency objective. We designed various model orchestration systems (Harpagon, DeepLat, TopInfer) to minimize the serving cost under latency objective via techniques such as dynamic batching, request dispatching and configuration decoupling. We also built various resource scaling systems (SLOpt, DeepChain) to maximize system goodput under bursty workload via techniques such as AoT compilation and model pre-warmup.

<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">
  <i style="white-space: nowrap !important;font-weight: bold;font-size: 1em;">Serving Specialized LLM</i>: Given the use cases, DNN-based applications face various deployment requirements. We have designed multi-stage inference systems (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3472883.3486993">Scrooge</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3450268.3453521">Rim</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3274808.3274813">Olympian</a>)</i> to manage DNN models in edge/cloud GPU clusters via techniques such as model co-location and model promotion. We also built specialized systems (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2971648.2971674">ALPS</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10188703">HRL</a>)</i> to handle complex cenario such as multi-modal input and heterogeneous hardware.
